# Create Your React App

Now you have a Serverless api setup and running. Lets create our react app.

For simplicity lets back up out of our lambda folder in the terminal:

```
cd ../
```

We will build our Serverless react app in a separate folder.

## Setup React App

Install and start your react app:

```
npx create-react-app sls-react
cd sls-react
npm run start
```

## Connect to your service

Add some logic to your client app to interact with our serverless api.

Open `src/App.js` component file.

Add a lifecycle method to the `App` class to initiate a fetch:

```
class App extends Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    fetch('<YOUR API URL>')
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(data => this.setState({data}));
  }
  ...
```

`<YOUR API URL>` should be the deployed url provided in the output logs when you deployed your Serverless lambda.

## React to your service

We need to do something with the data from our lambda. To do this we will:

* create a state within our component to persist our fetched data
* change our component render method to respond to changes in the state

First, add a constructor with an initial state:

```
class App extends Component {
  constructor() {
    super();

    this.state = {
      data: null
    }
  }
  ...
```


Finally, replace the render method to display the fetched data from our state:

```
  render() {
    const { data } = this.state

    return (
      <div className="App">
        <header className="App-header">
          <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
          <h1 className="App-title">{!data ? 'Loading...' : data.message }</h1>
        </header>
      </div>
    );
  }
```

**Note:** If the data has not loaded (data is null by default), a simple "Loading ..." message will be displayed by default whilst the data is being fetched.

*Why do this?* To visually see our component render data that has been fetched from our lambda service.

You should now be able to see the message, from your lambda, displayed in your browser.

## Build

Ok! Things are working locally. But **It Works On My Machine&trade;** is not good enough. We need to deploy this somewhere ... right? Yes!

Before we do this we need to build our application so its ready to run on any (modern ðŸ˜…) browser.

Run the following command to build your app:
```
npm run build
```

Once complete you will see all the files we need to deploy inside the `./build` folder.

Run the following command to test that your built app will work as expected:

```
npx serve --open --single build
```

**Great!** Ready to deploy ðŸ’ª!

## Deploy with Serverless

Because our react app runs in the browser and is not rendered server side, we can simply deploy our code to S3. Simple!?

### Serverless setup

First, install `serverless` as a dev dependency

```
npm install --save-dev serverless
```

Update your `package.json` with a script alias for `serverless` as `sls`

```
scripts: {
  ...
  "sls": "serverless"
  ...
}
...
```

Next, we need to initialise your project with severless:

```
npm run sls -- create --template hello-world
```

The `hello-world` template will create two files; `handler.js` and `serverless.yml`. **DELETE** `handler.js`. We do not need it.

**ASIDE** `serverless create` annoyingly overwrites your `.gitignore`, so double check that file is as you want. Not a big deal to just move on.

Next install the `serverless-s3-deploy` plugin:

```
npm run sls -- plugin install -n serverless-s3-sync
```

This will update your `serverless.yml` with a new dependency. Check it out!

## Configure Serverless to upload to S3

Ok we are going to cheat here! Replace your entire `serverless.yml` with the following:

```
service: <YOUR CLIENT APP NAME>

provider:
  name: aws
  runtime: nodejs8.10
  region: <YOUR DESIRED REGION>

plugins:
  - serverless-s3-sync

custom:
  bucketName: ${self:service}-assets
  s3Sync:
    - bucketName: ${self:custom.bucketName}
      localDir: build/
      acl: public-read
      params:
        - index.html

resources:
  Resources:
      AssetsBucket:
        Type: AWS::S3::Bucket
        Properties:
          BucketName: ${self:custom.bucketName}
          AccessControl: PublicRead
          WebsiteConfiguration:
            IndexDocument: index.html
```

**IMPORTANT** You need to make the following changes to the configuration:
* replace `<YOUR DESIRED REGION>` e.g eu-west-1
* replace `<YOUR CLIENT APP NAME>`
* replace `<YOUR DESIRED BUCKET NAME>` with a globally unique name

Time to deploy! Run the following command:

```
npm run sls -- deploy
```

ðŸ˜…: If you get an error from AWS please make sure you have your aws credentials setup and correct permissions! Click [here](http://bit.ly/aws-creds-setup) for more information on how to configure or visit http://bit.ly/aws-creds-setup.

No errors `===` **SUCCESS**. You should now be able to access your app at the following url:

`http://<YOUR DESIRED BUCKET NAME>.s3-website-<YOUR DESIRED REGION>.amazonaws.com`
